            2.1 How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in
            terms of demand from employers?
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            IT specific skills ranked between the ideal jobs are as follows. The
            highest-ranking skills between the ideal jobs are the skills of
            programming and management skills. 4/6 of the ideal jobs require
            programming skills and amongst them SQL and Java rank the highest with
            a combined result of around 10,000 asked from postings available to
            Burning Glass. Skills required from the management jobs also have
            Business Process and Project management also rank highly with a
            combined 20000 listings.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            On the other end of the spectrum however, we do have skills that do not
            rank within the top 10 listed such as Security architecture and
            Computer Game Design, however, the game design could potentially be
            paired with coding skills so that is up to subjective analysis.

            2.2 How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms
            of demand from employers?
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            Almost all the jobs had similar general skills which ranged from
            communication skills to problem solving and trouble shooting. Skills
            relating to problem solving, trouble shooting, and communication ranked
            amongst the highest with a combined 18,000 listings. As for the lowest
            ranked, there was no low ranked skills.

    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            The three highest ranking IT-specific skills that wasn’t amongst our

    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            As almost all of our general skills were included in the Top required
            there were only a few outliers. These are: Passion for videogames,
            Creativity and Up to Date understand of game trends.

            because my ideal job - a Software Tester - can fall under the banner of

            both of which are fairly high on the demand list.”

            need arises. So, no, my Ideal job has not changed but having looked at
            the statistics, I think that a Software Engineer may have more job
            security, thus I would not be opposed branching out.”

            ““After referring to the industry statistics, the data indicates that
            the job that was ideal for me, is not much in demand, hence I changed
            my mind and my vision of my ideal job. Now, I consider my ideal job as
            java developer as it has more demand and I have some knowledge about
            java programming which will help me to grip my hands-on JAVA. Moreover,
            as I love to code in PHP, to learn java's frameworks from basic to
            advanced level will be quite challenging for me but, I will put all my
            possible inputs to obtain the skills required to become a java
            developer and will get a job as java developer in a reputed company.”
