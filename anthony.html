       			<p>Hi, my name is Anthony Tran and I am second year studying at RMIT University. During my first year, I studied Bachelor of Business (Information Systems)
       			<p>however did not enjoy that course and decided to switch over to Information Technology which I currently enjoy!.

 <section id="Interest in IT">
       				<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
<p> My interest in IT begins with me in primary school. Back when I was a a kid, I was very fond of electronics and my dad often bought me consoles which I could play on as entertainment. As I grew older, he eventually bought me my very own computer in which I grew a bond to. I would spend hours after hours on the computer mainly playing video games. As a result, I grew up in a very technologically savy environment having experiences with many different consoles and technology. This would end up leading me to pickup computer-based subjects in highschool such as Informatics and Software Development. Although my IT skills mainly come from searching up the solution in Google and using trial and error to solve technological problems, it has become my passion to work within the Information Technology department which has led to me choosing to study a tech-based course. I chose to study at RMIT as their Information Technology course is renowned for being one of the best and it was something I was passionate about growing up. During my time here at RMIT, I expect to learn a variety of things to help me embark on my career. One of the things I'm most fond about is learning to program. One of the things my dad often told me as I grew up was that I shouldn't be wasting my time playing games but rather I should be learning how to make games so other people could play them. This stuck to me as I always loved games and would someday love to become good enough at programming that I could create games myself.

 <section id="Games Designer">
       				<h3>Games Designer</h3>
                    <p> Games designers come up with new and innovative ways to design and create games. They develop the game and come up with ideas such as how the game is played, the rules of the game, the story and setting etc. Game Designers may also assist with the programming of the game and the developmental stage of the game. This job application appeals to me as I love working in a team environment and this job is exactly that. Game designers work with other developers to produce games and programs for people to enjoy. This particular job application stands out as it's involved with a big renowned company as it is a 'leading innovator in the global gaming industry.' They boast about the great workplace culture and facilities which all appeal to me as a great company to work for. The role is also intriguing as I grew up playing games myself and would love the opportunity to deisng/program my own game aswell. This role is open to those with intermediate skills in C++ or other related programs which is what I would have to develop if I would like to apply for this position. However, the position does not specify the need for prior experience in the same field however familiarity with the concept and a passion for games does play a role in the success of candidates who do apply. I believe that my passion for games and technological experience would give me the upper edge over other candidates who may be applying for the same position. If I were to succeed and try to apply for this role, I would firstly master a programming language such as Java or C++. Finishing my bachelors in Information Technology would also be beneficial in that the courses learned over University would prove to be useful and helpful in the job role and less formal training would be needed as I would already have knowledge and expertise. The fact that the job application has not set out a minimum set years of experience, this allows me as a graduate the oportunity to dive into the game designer role and would be a great stepping stone in my career.

       				<h3>Myer-Briggs Test</h3>
                    <p> The results of my Myer-Briggs Test was an Entertainer ESFP-T. An entertainer result entails an outgoing personality, one that enjoys the presence of other people and is an utterly social person. The results of this test speaks very truly about my personality as I believe that I am an outgoing individual who loves to socialise and interact with other people. As a result, my behaviour in a team would ensure high morale of the team environment and a fun attitude. My behaviour in a team would be to get the job done but in a fun and exciting manner. When taking this into account when forming a team, I believe that as an 'Entertainer', I would get along with all types of people being a social person and would not mind being assigned into any team.

       				<h3>Learning style test</h3>
                    <p> The result of my learning style test was a Tactile learner. I learn things by 'touching' and 'doing' rather than listening or reading. I learn by experiencing firsthand experiences and through physical and 'hands on' learning. As a tactile learner, I am a very coordinated and prefer to use a computer rather than textbook for learning. This result means that I learn things mainly through practicals rather than lectures and theory. These results may influence my behaviour in a team as I prefer to go out there and do things physically rather than sit down and write. When taking into consideration the forming of a team, I would have to take into account the rest of the team's learning styles and try to find other people with a similar learning style as we could all engage in the activity as a team and try tackle the problem head on.

       				<h3>Creativity test</h3>
                    <p> The results of my online creativity test show a creativity score of 46.66. The average creativity score is a 63.13. This result shows that my creativity is to be below that of the average person. This result shows that I am not very creative when it comes to making up my own original ideas and would rather take inspiration from other people in order to help me work on my own idea. This can be shown my drawing skills or lack thereof as I find it difficult to imagine things on the fly and put it onto paper. These results may impact my behaviour in a team as I may find it difficult to come up with original ideas and inspirations and would need my team to bounce around ideas to help me in a team environment. As a result, when taking my creativity into account when forming a team, I should try ensure that there is atleast one creative person on the team to help boost the team's creaitivty in developing a good idea or project.
