    <h2>Group Reflection</h2>
    <h3>Anthony</h3>
    <p>What went well during this assignment was our team’s ability to work together collectively  as a group. Something that could have been improved upon for our group was the team’s ability to effectively coordinate a time to meet up. One thing that was surprising was the group’s cohesion and the bond that was developed within this short period of time. I very much enjoyed working alongside my group members and had fun every time. One thing that I have learned about groups is that it is much easier than working individually on an assignment as having more brains is better than one. </p>
    <h3>Evan</h3>
    <p>I feel the team worked very well on this assignment - we got off to a very late start, and yet we managed to get the work done on time. We could definitely have improved on coordinating our meeting times - many of them did not suit the schedules of all our members, and so few of our meetings had all members involved. I was surprised by how quickly we got the work done in spite of our late start - we, together, completed the entire assignment in less than a week. I've learned through this assignment that groups get progressively more difficult (and frustrating) to coordinate the more members there are in the group.</p>
    <h3>Matthew</h3>
    <p>What went well was our group communication. Once we all started on the assignment having everyone know what their job or role was that they were going contributing to the assignment our group completed the work. What could be improved was our time management having us using the last week before the assignment is due to complete the whole assignment was a bit challenging and we could have spread out the work across multiple weeks. One thing that was surprising was how fast we came together and completed the assignment with our group starting the assignment very late but by having everyone’s different skills come together it made completing the assignment easier within the time period we gave ourselves. One thing that I have learned about groups is that once everyone knows what they are doing and are comfortable doing that work, the group will excel and get the work done at a high standard.</p>
    <h3>Mehmet</h3>
    <p>In review, our group although starting late, worked great in terms of getting the work done, communicating issues and updating on where we were individually at in terms of progress on the delegated sections. However, something that could be improved is the coordination of group meetings regarding timing. This was caused by the time constraints created by us starting late so it's understandable why it happened. One thing that was surprising about this group assignment is us pulling it off in the time that we did. One thing I have learned about groups is scheduling times for meetings are extremely important as multiple dynamic schedules of group member creates some difficulties whilst doing meetings on the fly. </p>
    <h3>Nicholas</h3>
    <p>What went well? We managed to get everything finished on time. We all got along very well. As a group we had no challenges in direction or decisions. Everything was agreed to perfectly. What could be improved? We were unorganised to begin with and I was not informed of any meetings on team so I had not shown up to the first few meetings. Overall there was a lack of activity until the final week. At least one thing that was surprising. We managed to finish the project in 5 days with only two meetings having had everyone attend. At least ine thing that you have learned about groups. If everyone works diligently then The work load drops significantly. With all people working on their respective roles, the work was completed very quickly. I do wish I had contributed more however everyone had their respective roles and together that means the group can finish everything effectively and efficiently.</p>
