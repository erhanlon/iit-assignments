        <p>I am Australian born who has a Maltese and Greek background. I have only completed year 12 so far completing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>English</li>
            <li>Further Maths</li>
            <li>Software Development</li>
            <li>Business Management</li>
            <li>P.E</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My hobbies include listening to music and watching sport in my spare time, especially AFL where I support the Carlton Football Club.</p></p>
        <p>My I.T experience experience is very limited, only having completed Software Development through VCE, giving me a basic understanding of the principles involved within the IT world.</p>
        <p>My interests in IT at the moment are Networking and Security, as they seem interesting to explore and make a potential career out of.</p>
