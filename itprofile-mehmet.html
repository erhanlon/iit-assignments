<p>My interest in IT mostly resides in the gaming industry. However, I believe it would be more beneficial to get my Bachelor in IT due to the various pathways it opens for me. My interest in IT started early on in my life around the age of 3-4, when I got my first gaming console. Ever since I have been intrigued by the various things possible with IT and how ideas can be brought to life through the use of IT. My IT experience is average.
</p>
<p> I chose to study at RMIT because the research I did showed that RMIT had the best IT courses.
</p>
<p>I expect to learn the necessary skills to utilise IT systems and have the skills to acquire a job in the IT field.</p>
<p> My Ideal Job is IT Manager.</p>
