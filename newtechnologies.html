        <h1>New Technologies</h1>
        <h2>Cloud Computing</h2>
        <h3>What does it do?</h3>
        <p> Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer resources, in particular data storage and computing power, without the direct management by the user. The state of art cloud computing can be found with Amazon web services, Microsoft azure, Google cloud, IBM cloud and Oracle cloud where there services allow users to upload or create their own websites, databases, game tech etc. all through their own cloud servers holding everyone’s data across the world .At the moment cloud computing can allow users to access data centres over the internet, with buildings containing thousands of servers that are empty and can be written to wirelessly holding whatever data is placed inside them by the user including photos, videos, music, documents etc. In the next decade Matt Riley who is CEO and co-founder of Swiftype reveals “every business will be operating primarily from the cloud, making way for more flexible yet more productive and efficient ways of working”. Eluding to the fact that hardware will not be a problem in the future, but software will be. A technological development that makes this possible is virtualization. Virtualization software separates a physical computing device into a more ‘virtual’ device, that can be easily managed to perform computing tasks. This commonly allows multiple operating systems to run on a computer system simultaneously. Another technological development that makes cloud computing possible is cloud servers. Cloud servers are virtual servers (compared to physical servers) running a cloud environment. They are hosted and managed via the internet and can be accessed remotely. This allows people to have less servers in their own department or building and have all their information stored virtually on a cloud server that can be accessed remotely through the user’s PC, laptop, phone etc.</p>
        <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
        <p>The potential impact of cloud computing is that it not only affects its users which ranges from businesses via public administrations through to consumers but also the I.T industry and the society and economy. According to the European Parliamentary Research Service in 2014 who wrote a study on “Potential and Impacts of Cloud Computing Services and Social Network Websites”, implies that cloud computing will change everything, impacting everyone, having all information stored online making it easy to access causing people to have all their information on the internet. The people most affected by this will be everyone as with most people possessions contained physically or having photos and documents stored on specific devices like computers or phones having it all connected via the internet affects the way everyone keeps their information making managing your data more important for everyone. This will create a redundancies for server administrators in businesses where they are no longer required to manage the server for the business as the physical server that holds their information could be in a different state or country with a building dedicated to holding countless servers for cloud computing.</p>
        <h>How does this affect you?</3>
        <p>In our daily lives cloud computing will affect us, as being students having our folders and documents on us is essential to keep all our work together but with cloud computing we are able to access any work that we want on any device that we want if all are accessed to server you a storing your data on. What will be different for us is that we don’t have to be device bound when we are working on different documents where we can work on word document on your home PC and then continue the work on your laptop and then display that same document on your phone and then your work PC all being connected by one single cloud server that holds all of your work. This may affect our friends and family as our family members may be getting older making it harder for them to understand or use cloud computing to its potential with no tangible object containing your data but a folder on the internet. However, our friends can access and share data more easily with files easily transferred from device to device, making it easier to share photos, videos, documents etc. easier.</p>
        <h2>Augmented Reality</h2>
        <h3>What does it do?</h3>
        <p>Augmented reality is technology that superimposes a computer-generated image on a user’s view of the real world, thus providing a composite view. The state of the art technology in augmented reality at the moment is currently used in many apps such as BBC Civilisations AR which allows users to learn about ancient times by viewing the globe from their phone that appears in front of them in with the camera on. Also the app Ink hunter where the technology is being used to have virtual designs for tattoos placed and fitted to the users body where they wish to have it in real time through the screen of phone to give users an idea of what their tattoos may look like. At the moment augmented reality is used by different companies to display technology in the real world through the phone or tablets camera. For example Ikea is using the technology to display their furniture through the customers phone to display any piece of furniture they sell and placing it in their home so their customers can see what the furniture looks like in their household. In the next three years according to Maryville university augmented reality must become “more of an afterthought on mobile devices”. Maryville university also state that once augmented reality is immersed industries including companies can integrate it into their websites and mobile apps so their customers can be seen with the products they are selling through the camera, or mobile devices informing us of our surroundings with real-time travel advisories and restaurant suggestions. A technological development that makes augmented reality possible is optical projection system. Optical projection is an optical system that forms a real image of a suitably illuminated object so it can be viewed. Another technological development is handheld devices. Handheld devices are technology that can be held in the hand for example a phone or tablet. These devices allow the user to use the technology inside the device like the camera to display the augmented reality on their device for work or fun purposes.</p>
        <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
        <p>The potential impact of augmented is that it can change the way businesses sell their items, the way people receive education and help us with our surroundings, changing the way we can interact with the world. With businesses able to have customers use their camera on their mobile device they can have the clothing, furniture, etc. displayed to them in real time to help the customer choose. Also, by having head mounted display being able have fields like the military and health care industries be able to create AR training simulations that can help educate them in their profession instead of running simulations that can put the students in places of danger. The people most affected will be businesses as they will have to adjust to the changes that augmented reality places having more features in their stores that allow customers to be more interactive virtually with their products or services. This will create jobs virtual reality specialists were there expertise in creating virtual objects will become required for different businesses having their products, services or games to be introduced into the virtual world for better customer experiences.</p>
        <h3>How does this affect you?</h3>
        <p>In our everyday life this will affect us as with technology growing and being introduced into different businesses, the way we receive information and interact with the world will be different, with apps allowing us to virtually try on clothes before we purchase them or play games that virtually interact with our surroundings like Pokemon go. What will be different for us is that the information will be displayed to us virtually that interacts with reality, having our real world interactions be connected to our virtual interactions having our devices display items or recommendations of real items that exist. This might affect our friends and family members, with having our family be able create or design their house more efficiently with the living space virtually designed having all virtual furniture added before buying and creating the room. Also, when with friends being able to see virtually through our mobile devices what restaurants or activities are available in the area affect how we choose to spend our time and where we spend our time.</p>
