        <p>Our group interviewed Renee McMillan-Tolley, who works at Accenture, for our assignment.</p>
        <p>The interview was very informative, and Renee contributed many helpful tidbits of information that will be helpful to us in the future.</p>
        <p>An overview of the discussion is as follows:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>What is your job title?</dt>
            <dd>I work at Accenture, and we really like long titles - I am a Scrum Master and Developer.</dd>
            <dt>What kind of work do you do?</dt>
            <dd>I basically keep the team on track - I organise what everyone does, but the team decides themselves <i>how</i> to do things. I essentially lead a team of Full Stack Developers.</dd>
            <dt>What does a typical work day consist of for you?</dt>
            <dd>It varies from day to day. For example, today I spent my morning focusing on automation and deployment of our chatbot - it was deployed somewhere where it hadn't been updated for a while.
                I've recently been helping out clients whose instances have broken because they're old. I've been trying to update the bot's explanations so clients can establish a connection.
                My days are usually split between running Agile activities, developing tests or deployments, or bugfixing our old code.</dd>
            <dt>What kind of people do you interact with regularly? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? The general public?</dt>
            <dd>We (my team) are very lucky. Accenture has 500 thousand employees, and within my group we have 500. This particular group is very code-heavy, so we're very internal, and interact mostly with other developers. 
                If I get messaged by someone external, it's usually someone telling me about a bug. Thankfully, they're usually not angry; they're pretty polite. I love my job. I had to work hard to get into a position where I'm surrounded by devs, but now that I am, the work environment is pretty chill.</dd>
            <dt>Where do you spend most of your time?</dt>
            <dd>At home, like most people these last couple months. Before the COVID lockdown, I was often at the main office next to Flinders St, or at one of the other offices near Melbourne Central or Parliament stations.</dd>
            <dt>How has COVID impacted your workplace?</dt>
            <dd>We're doing well in our unit - we work with a chatbot, so we can use it to automatically message everyone to make sure they're alright. We've been using it to message more than 300 thousand people - it's pretty cool. Thankfully, our jobs aren't on the line. Lots of other IT companies have had to dock or lay off workers.</dd>
            <dt>What aspect of your position is most challenging?</dt>
            <dd>It's always the people - code can be debugged. It doesn't have to necessarily be efficient, but people are harder. Because of COVID, people in our unit are doing a large amount of overtime - some people are doing 14 hours a day, every day, or the last 6 weeks, and I'm concerned about their health.
                Previously it was hierarchy - people straight from uni are often young and have fresh ideas, but in areas where people are a lot older, sometimes they don't want to hear about what's new.</dd>
